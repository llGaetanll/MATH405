# Linear Algebra

In this repo, you'll find two PDFs. One is my notes for the class, called `notes.pdf`. The other is `examples.pdf`, which is a list of example problems with provided solutions to help you practice your understanding. 

## Help me out!

If you notice a mistake or oversight, please let me know. You can do this in one of two ways

- If you have a GitHub account, I would prefer that you open an issue (it boosts my GH statistics to close issues lol)
- If you don't have a GitHub account, just contact me directly

This also applies if you want to contribute anything! Ideas are very welcome :)
